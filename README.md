This roguelike game was built for the Free Code Camp project at https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game/

The game is built with React/Redux, and styled using SCSS.

The challenge for me in porting this over from CodePen to GitHub is going to be in figuring out how to properly set up the React/Redux -- in CodePen, I just had to select a pre-processor and it was good to go! I could just copy the processed code into this project, but I want to try to actually set it up to work with the code I wrote.
