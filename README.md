This roguelike game was built for the Free Code Camp project at https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game/

The game is built with React/Redux and JSX, and styled using SCSS. It was originally built in CodePen at https://codepen.io/ogdendavis/full/MVxBjb/

The main modifications I made to this project to bring it off of CodePen were updating index.html to include basic HTML structure and links to the stylesheet and scripts.

I stuck with using the link to JSX instead of using Babel as a preprocessor because I'm not really worried about a slower load time on this page, and my focus was on getting a working demo independent of CodePen. Updating the project to include this is left as an exercise for the future!
